		 * 
		 * 
		 * Normally multiple people working on multiple things.
		 * 1st guy doing some activity
		 * 2nd doing some
		 * and so-on
		 * they working as one team working on same project
		 * 
		 * so at the end of the day we need to integrate all the task and we need to keep the task 
		 * at the common place.
		 * So for this we need to use configuration management or Version control system
		 * So here Git and Github are used 
		 * for ex- git is an local repository 
		 * and GitHub is an our Remote repository.
		 * means git is in Install on your local repository.
		 * and everybody in the team they can maitain the code version in this git local repository.
		 * And end of the day they have to push their code in remote repository
		 * Basiclly github is a server that perticular server can be used by using the git software
		 * 
		 * Git- Git is a version control system used to track changes in computer files.Its a tool to 
		 * manage your code and file history while coordinating work remotely on those file with others.
		 * 
		 * sometimes what happen there are multiple people work multiple think and team lead he is main
		 * responsible guys to delever the project ,so what the team lead do it he will not allow to
		 * everybody to checking pushing the code directly into a remote repository.
		 * team lead just to inform to everybody of team member to commit there code into local branches
		 * and to review all the code team lead.Lead reviev that perticular code and once they give approval
		 * that code then team member merge that code into remote repository.
		 * 
		 * So there is one repository are there in github that is called as master Branch.
		 * 
		 * Github-  Github is a hosting service for git repositories. Git is the tool,while github is the
		 *          service to use git.  But in this server site threre are some chances to get confilct.
		 *          
		 * 
		 * Braching
		 * Merging
		 * 
		 * this are the two main concept.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Cloning - Everybody in the team will get perticular one copy of that project in there
		 *           local system.And they can perform the task on that project in their local system.
